.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

The Siteimprove CMS plugin bridges the gap between the TYPO3 CMS and the
`Siteimprove Intelligence Platform <https://siteimprove.com/>`__. With the
plugin installed, your team can scan your website for errors as soon as a page
is published, allowing you to fix mistakes, optimize content, and manage your
site more efficiently. Once the detected issues have been assessed, you can
re-check the relevant page in real-time and determine if further actions are
needed.

Benefits of the Siteimprove CMS Plugin
--------------------------------------

The Siteimprove CSM Plugin provides insights into:

* Misspellings and broken links
* Readability levels
* Accessibility issues (A, AA, AAA conformance level)
* High-priority policies
* SEO: technical, content, UX, and mobile
* Page visits and page views
* Feedback rating and comments
* The impact of unpublishing a specific page
* URL Shortener data and its impact on your digital assets
